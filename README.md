# Pass-Gen
## Description 
This password generator was created to help users generate a new password for their accounts.

## Usage 
Users will be able to use the password generator to generate a password based on certain conditions that the users choose. The user will be able to choose a length between characters that spans from 8 all the way to 128: anything less or more will be nulled. Users will also be able to choose if they want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. The password generator will then generate the password based on the conditions the user selected.
